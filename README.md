# Sorensen_dice_value

A similarity measure commonly used in the field of information retrieval and text mining. It quantifies the similarity between two sets by calculating the ratio of the size of their intersection to the total number of elements in both sets.

SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient = (2 * intersection_count) / (total number of elements in set1 + total number of elements in set2)
